    <h2>Why is donating to charity so important?</h2>
    <p>Whether you're donating money or time, giving promotes happiness, draws us closer to others, and strengthens empathy.<br>
     These are vital for a wealthy life, which starts from the inside. After a certain point, more income doesn't increase well-being â€” 
     <br>but empathetically giving to others does</p>

         <h2>What is the purpose of donation?</h2>
     <p>A donation is a gift for charity, humanitarian aid, or to benefit a cause. A donation may take various forms, including money, alms, services, <br>or goods 
         such as clothing, toys, food, or vehicles.
      A donation may satisfy medical needs such as blood or organs for transplant.</p>

      <h2>What happens when you donate money to charity?</h2>
      <p>Studies have found that it makes you happier to give than it does to receive. And because it lowers stress, <br>it can lower your risk of developing high blood pressure.
     It also gives you more ties to your community. Being more involved in the community can also<br> help with depression and make you happier.</p>

    <div  class="shade sec">
     <h2>How do you inspire people to give?</h2>
     <p>Focus appeals on a single person (and use it to overcome prejudice) ...
        Help people to feel their emotions, rather than repress them. ...<br>
        Tie giving to a sense of identity and purpose. ...
        Ask people to pay later (and thank them right away)</p>
